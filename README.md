his project is a Multithreade
This project is a simple Java-based recommendation system that suggests products to users based on their preferences. It uses user-based collaborative filtering to find similarities between users by comparing their ratings on common items. The system stores sample user ratings in a HashMap and calculates similarity using a distance-based formula. After identifying the most similar user, it recommends items that the similar user has rated but the target user has not. This approach helps personalize suggestions and improve user experience. The program runs in any standard Java compiler and demonstrates the basic working concept of recommendation engines used in e-commerce platforms.
